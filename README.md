# :pencil: Lessons

This project is to demonstrate my knowledge of Responsive UI and ability to recreate a website using a CSS library. 

For any business, an amazing visual representation of their product is a must. I wanted to showcase different ways of displaying a product customers could buy. Slideshows, tables, and image panels are a great way to do that. 

I didn't have that much difficulty creating this website. I consider myself proficient at CSS in general. Flexbox, grid, margins, padding, positioning etc. came very naturally to me. One thing that helped me was using Chrome devtools to change the CSS in the browser. Once I had the visual I wanted there, all I had to do was copy-paste the CSS declaration from the browser to VSCode. Building up from mobile to desktop simplifies the code as well.
